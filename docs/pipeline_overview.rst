Overview of Full Pipeline
=================

You will learn how to complete a full machine learning pipeline for weather prediction!

The steps of this pipeline include:

Step 1: Dataset Creation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use `ufs2arco` to create training and validation datasets with NOAA Replay reanalysis

Step 2: Train a Graph-Based Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use `anemoi-core` modules to train a graph-based model

Step 3: Create a Forecast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use `anemoi-inference` to run inference

Step 4: Verify a Forecast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use `wxvx` to verify a forecast
